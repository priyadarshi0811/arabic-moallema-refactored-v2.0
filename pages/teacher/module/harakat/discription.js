          disc="The kasra in phonics is the short /i/ sound. It looks exactly like the fatha but is under the consonant. The word “sit” represents this vowel perfectly. The Arabic kasra is كسرة and is it presented like this under its consonant: ِ
                The word kasra refers to something being broken or has broken. Similarly, this short Arabic vowel does the same for a word in the sense that it takes it down, or almost breaks it. For example, the letter فis pronounced /fa’/, however, with the kasra it becomes فِ pronounced /fi/. It took the letter down.
                The kasra is taken from the long vowel ي pronounced /ya/, such as the case in the word “sleep.” Let’s look at an example:
